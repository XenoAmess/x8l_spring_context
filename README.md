#x8l_spring-context

X8l data format for Spring framework ApplicationContext.

Use this we can replace bean.xml to bean.x8l when handling spring.

Right now we have a shabby demo version showing possibility only,
as I have no effort to maintain a real high performance one.

But at least it is usable.
